# cscript
My implementation of Robert Nystrom's jlox interpreter, ported to C++.

### Requirements
- C++ (20 or later)
- Unix-based OS (does not support Windows)

To get started, clone this repository and run:
- `make all` to get a build directory and the executable
- `make clean` to remove the build directory
- `make clear` to remove the build directory and the executable
- `./cscpt.out` with no arguments to enter the REPL, or a cscript file (`.cscpt`) as an argument to run it
